# The role of white matter variability in TMS neuromodulatory effects

 Contains scripts and data to run the behavioural analyses and generate the plots described in the paper "The role of white matter variability in TMS neuromodulatory effects" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brs.2024.11.006).

The following files can be found here: 

- lmms_seen_acc: linear mixed-effects models for the analysis of the proportion of seen trials and ACC
- lmms_rt: linear mixed-effects models for RTs analysis
- rt_plots and acc_seen_plots: code to generate the plots included in the paper.
- raw_data_all.csv: raw data, used for the ACC and proportion of seen analyses
- rt_filtered.csv: filtered raw data, used for the RTs analysis
